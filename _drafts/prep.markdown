## About me

- **Significant mid-life upgrade programme** : taking control of the primary interface between new and old systems, seeking agreement between interested parties.
- **Software lead on PV** : driving software effort, offering demos to stakeholders. Encourage culture of demoing narrow slices of functionality early – I'm a firm believer that you have to use a product as an end user to really understand if it works (validation).
- **Mini research projects for graduates** : curate a library of self-contained non-trivial introductory projects for new starters, learn the languages using real industry data/structures from the start
- **Highlighting software obsolescence** : investigating areas of risk for maintain software for long service life products, lobby senior technical people, raising awareness of important advances in software. 

## Why work here

I think it's in your interests to keep ahead of the game and continually assess performance. You understand the importance of moving forward with technology, something that is always a fight in my current work: it's usually how long can we stay still for rather than how can we exploit this new feature/technology. I'd like the opportunity to immerse myself in a new domain.

## Reasons for leaving

Research funding is being cut and what's left is increasingly being used to develop firmware. There is exciting new development going on but it's all in firmware; of late the software effort is application level – messaging: connecting up existing systems – rather than application development. So advances are being made at the front end (FPGAs) but at this stage – before a large contract has been landed – effort isn't being spent on the software to exploit these improvements. There's also the possibility of selling the hardware alone and letting customers develop their own software.

Also the attitude to moving software forward isn't good, it's a constant effort to keep things moving forward but the general approach is don't change it until we have to. So we're still bidding solutions that run are deployed on XP or RHEL 5. As a company we understand and can market firmware but software is very much misunderstood. It's not looking for advances in software that could be exploited, it's how long can we get away without changing it?

Having lobbied to move the current Modern C++ for a while it's finally being adopted but there's a huge legacy codebase and a team of developers who are still writing C with classes.

I think there are lots of missed opportunities for developing the business but all the eggs are being put in the one basket.

## Notes

- Analytical skills: Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How long did it take you to arrive at a solution? If you had to design/ architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?
- Coding skills: Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style?
- Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals: Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?
- Experience: Have you made good technical decisions in the past? Have you built interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
- Culture fit / Communication skills: Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

## Questions

- "Why do you want to work for \<company\>?
- "What was the hardest bug you've faced?"
- For example, one question I sometimes ask is to find all positive integer solutions under 1,000 to a 3 + b 3  
= c 3 + d 3 (page 68).

## Before the interview

### One week

- Rehearse stories from the interview prep grid (pg 32).
- Re-read Algorithm Approaches (pg 67).
- Re-read Big 0 section (pg 38).

### Day before

- Rehearse each story from **interview prep grid** once
- Continue to practice questions & review your list of mistakes.
- Review Powers of 2 table (pg 61). Print for a phone interview

### Day of

- Wake up in plenty of time to eat a good breakfast & be on time.
- Remember to talk out loud. Show how you think.
- Be Confident (Not Cocky!)

## Responding to Behavioral Questions

- Be Specific, Not Arrogant
- Limit Details
- Focus on Yourself, Not Your Team (there's no we in I)
- Give Structured Answers: nugget first, S.A.R. (Situation, Action, Result)

## So, tell me about yourself ...
